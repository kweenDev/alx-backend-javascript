# ES6 Basics

## Overview

This project is designed to teach you the fundamentals of **ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)**, a significant update to the JavaScript programming language. ES6 introduced many new features that have since become the foundation of modern JavaScript development. This project covers various essential topics, including:

- Block-scoped variables (`const`, `let`)
- Arrow functions
- Rest and Spread operators
- Template literals
- Object property shorthand and computed property names

By the end of this project, you'll have hands-on experience implementing these features, ensuring your code adheres to modern JavaScript best practices.

## Project Structure

- **0-constants.js**: Demonstrates the use of `const` and `let` for defining variables.
- **1-block-scoped.js**: Illustrates block scoping using `let` and `const` in conditional structures.
- **2-arrow-functions.js**: Uses arrow functions to simplify code and maintain the correct `this` context.
- **3-rest-parameter.js**: Showcases the rest parameter to handle an arbitrary number of function arguments.
- **4-spread-operator.js**: Demonstrates how to use the spread operator for array and string manipulation.
- **5-template-literals.js**: Utilizes template literals for creating strings with embedded variables.
- **6-object-enhancements.js**: Covers object property shorthand and computed property names.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript syntax and ES5 concepts.
- Node.js installed to run the code locally.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/es6-basics.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd es6-basics
   ```

3. Run each file using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node 0-constants.js
   ```

## Usage

Each file in this project demonstrates a unique feature of ES6. You can run the files individually to see the output in your terminal or browser's console. These concepts are widely used in modern web applications, so practice and familiarity will help in becoming proficient with ES6.
